      <img src="assets/images/results/indie.png" alt="Indie">
      <p>Independent filmmaking is alive and well thanks to outside the box thinkers like these movie-goers! Indies
        appreciate getting the chance to see the full artistic vision of the director without major studios being
        involved and leaving meaningful scenes on the cutting room floor. Being the artistic type, it intrigues Indies
        to see what people can do using a 'more with less' approach to their filming. There are countless movies of this
        caliber available. Indies can swing by their local theaters, support the independent film industry, and
        experience art in motion!</p>
